Here is a shell code to compile and run c++ codes easily. 
# I wrote this code for vim text editor if u want to change the editor use this command:- 
sed -i 's/vim/new-editor-name/g' compilerc++.sh 
to use this file gcc must be pre installed. 
# before run the file use this command:- 
chmod 777 compilerc++.sh
